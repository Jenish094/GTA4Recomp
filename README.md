GTA4Recomp
GTA4 (USA) copy of the game was used for this

GTA4RecompLib - The config files, gamefiles and the compiled ppc.
GTA4Recomp/ - The runtime, the actual hard bit. I will be using xenia and parts of UnleashedRecomp in order to build this. obviously, this cant even be copy pasted from anywhere since its specific to GTA4. That sucks.

As goes for most of the files and other projects, the GTA4Recomp folder will have many files made by other sources including reverse engineering projects, other recompilations and primarily, marathon and unleashedrecomp.

My sources are in docs/SOURCE.md which probably isnt updated yet but I have a list of all my sources on an unsaved notepad file and I will add all of them before the end of this project.

The code is referenced primarily as Fernando_Recomp as i don't want any of the code to be called gta4 so i dont risk a DMCA
